      The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic
      dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf
      is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be
      domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the
      development of agriculture.

              German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[24] The breed
              standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males,
              and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for females.[25][26][27] German Shepherds
              are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to
              8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard
              weight range.[28] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut
              muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are
              medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open
              at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during
              movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when
              excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as
              stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[26] German
              Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick
              undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long.
              The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired
              variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs
              across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against
              standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it
              can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault,
              in the American Kennel Club.[26][28][29] The FCI accepted the
              long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the
              short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[30] Most commonly,
              German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour
              varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range
              from a classic "saddle" to an overall "blanket". Rarer colour
              variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver,
              blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are
              acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and
              liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is
              grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation
              at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[28]

              German Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working
              dogs.[54] They are known for being easy to train and good for
              performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially
              well known for their police work, being used for tracking
              criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of
              suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been
              used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are
              usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers
              to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[55]
              German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to
              parachute from aircraft[56] or as anti-tank weapons. They were
              used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal
              guard dogs.[4] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign
              servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[4] The
              German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide
              variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue,
              cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection,
              accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They
              are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of
              smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.[55] At
              one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost
              exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired.
              When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s
              under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained
              were German Shepherd females.[57] An experiment in temperament
              testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds
              showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional
              stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening
              situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the
              German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive
              behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were
              more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more
              suited to police work.[58] Currently, Labradors and Golden
              Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are
              still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the
              dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while
              the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[59]
              The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom
              trains some German Shepherds,[60] while the comparable
              organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers,

            <h4>Chihuahua</h4>
            <img class="imga" src="images/chi1.jpg" title="Chihuahua" />
            <p>
              Chihuahuas are the smallest breed recognized by some kennel
              clubs.[10] Current breed standards defined by registries specify
              an "apple-head" or "apple-dome" skull conformation.[11] Chihuahuas
              occur in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or
              splashed.[12] Apple-dome Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and
              large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.[10]
              The stop is well defined, forming a near-90-degree angle where the
              muzzle meets the skull.[13] Dogs of the older "deer" type, with a
              flat-topped head, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer,
              more slender legs, may still be registered, but the deer head is
              not considered a separate type in competition and a deer-head
              dog's digression from the breed standard is considered a
              fault.[11][13] Breed standards for this dog do not generally
              specify a height; only a weight and a description of their overall
              proportions. Generally, the height ranges between 6 and 9 in (15
              and 23 cm);[10] however, some dogs grow as tall as 30 to 38 cm (12
              to 15 in). Both British and American breed standards state that a
              Chihuahua must not weigh more than 5.9 lb (2.7 kg) for
              conformation.[10] However, the British standard also states that a
              weight of 4–6 lb (1.8–2.7 kg) is preferred. A clause stating "if
              two dogs are equally good in type, the more diminutive one is
              preferred" was removed in 2009.[14] The Fédération Cynologique
              Internationale standard calls for dogs ideally between 1.5 and 3.0
              kg (3.3 and 6.6 lbs), although smaller ones are acceptable in the
              show ring.[15] Pet Chihuahuas (those bred or purchased as
              companions rather than as show dogs) often range above these
              weights, even above 10 lb (4.5 kg), if they have large bone
              structures or are allowed to become overweight.[10] This does not
              mean that they are not purebred Chihuahuas; they just do not meet
              the requirements to enter a conformation show. Oversized
              Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines.
              Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same
              litter can mature in drastically different sizes from one another.
              Also, larger breeding females are less likely to experience
              dystocia (obstructed labor). Many breeders try to breed Chihuahuas
              to be as small as possible, because those marketed as "teacup" or
              "tiny teacup" demand higher prices.[16] The Fédération Cynologique
              Internationale, which represents the major kennel clubs of 84
              countries, disqualified the merle coat pattern, which appears
              mottled.[15] In May 2007, The Kennel Club decided not to register
              puppies with this coloration due to the health risks associated
              with the responsible gene, and in December of that year, formally
              amended its breed standard to disqualify merle dogs.[17] Like many
              other small dogs, the Chihuahua may display above-average
              aggression toward people and other dogs.

              The Chihuahua has some genetic predisposition to several
              neurological diseases, among them atlantoaxial instability, ceroid
              lipofuscinosis, congenital deafness, congenital hydrocephalus,
              muscular dystrophy, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and
              neuroaxonal dystrophy.[20]: 3 [21] In a radiographical study of
              canine periodontal disease in 2001, the Chihuahua was found to
              have the lowest incidence of the six breeds
              studied.[22]: 206 [23]: 532  The predisposition to medial patellar
              luxation is believed to be significant.[24]: 46  Additionally, the
              main cause of death in Chihuahua's has been found to be heart
              failure. The occurrence of heart failure is more likely to happen
              during their golden years. It has been noted that 75% of heart
              diseases has been due to valve deterioration. A valve, which
              regulates their blood flow, becomes deformed overtime. This
              deformity that increases over the years causes their blood to leak
              around the valve, which ultimately strains the heart and can be
              their cause of death.[25]

            <h4>Dobermann</h4>
            <img class="imga" src="images/dm1.jpg" title="Dobermann" />
            <p>
              The Dobermann (/ˈdoʊbərmən/; German pronunciation: [ˈdoːbɐman]),
              or Doberman Pinscher in the United States and Canada, is a
              medium-large breed of domestic dog that was originally developed
              around 1890 by Louis Dobermann, a tax collector from Germany.[2]
              The Dobermann has a long muzzle. It stands on its pads and is not
              usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful
              gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted and the tail
              is docked. However, in some countries, these procedures are now
              illegal and it is often considered cruel and unnecessary.
              Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above
              the eyes, and underneath the tail. Dobermanns are known to be
              intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard
              dogs
            </p>
            <p>
              World breed standards are published by the Fédération Cynologique
              Internationale, or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice
              of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann
              breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list.
              To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The
              American Kennel Club (AKC) has its own standards, as do some other
              countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed
              standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is
              also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet
              these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be
              almost square. It should also appear elegant and noble. The dog
              was originally intended as a guard dog,[4][5] so males typically
              have a muscular and intimidating appearance.[4][5] Females are
              usually thinner, but should not be spindly. The AKC breed standard
              differs from the FCI standards, with the latter being an often
              larger and heavier dog. This has led some to argue that Dobermanns
              and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated
              differently.

              Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along
              with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally
              thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a
              short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll
              above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and
              pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is
              short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle,
              and piebald.[16] They have short tails that can either hang down
              straight or be tucked in a coiled "corkscrew" into a tail pocket.
              In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are 55 lb (25 kg) for a
              male and 50 lb (23 kg) for a female.[19] In the United States, the
              standard calls for a smaller dog — a typical mature male weighs 50
              lb (23 kg), while mature females weigh about 40 lb (18 kg).[20].
              According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's
              disposition should be "equable and kind, resolute, and courageous
              (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacifist and
              dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the
              expression and behavior".[21] Breeders have worked to remove
              aggression from the breed.[16] Most have a friendly, patient, but
              stubborn nature. Bulldogs are recognized as excellent family pets
              because of their tendency to form strong bonds with children.[16]
              Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with
              children, other dogs, and other pets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite slow maturation so that growing up is rarely achieved by
              two and a half years, Bulldogs' lives are relatively short. At
              five to six years old, they start to show signs of aging.[citation
              needed] A 2004 UK survey of 180 Bulldog deaths puts the median age
              at death at 6 years 3 months. The leading cause of death of
              Bulldogs in the survey was cardiac related (20%), cancer (18%),
              and old age (9%). Those that died of old age had an average
              lifespan of 10 to 11 years.[2] A 2013 UK vet clinic survey of 26
              Bulldogs puts the median lifespan at 8.4 years with an
              interquartile range of 3.2–11.3 years.[3] The UK Bulldog Breed
              Council website lists the average life span of the breed as 8–10
              years. A study by the Royal Veterinary College found that Bulldogs
              are a much less healthy breed than average, with over twice the
              odds of being diagnosed with at least one of the common dog
              disorders investigated in the study.[25] The English Bulldog is
              among the breeds that are most severely affected by brachycephalic
              airway obstructive syndrome, due to extreme brachyphalia
              (shortened snout), a large tongue and palate, and other
              morphological issues.[26][27] Like all brachycephalic dogs, bully
              breeds often suffer from brachycephalic airway obstructive
              syndrome (BAOS). A degree of BOAS has been normalized in the
              breed, as an inevitable consequence of their distinctive face.[26]
              The condition manifests in a variety of ways, often in the form of
              intolerance to heat and physical exertion. Since dogs regulate
              heat primarily by panting, Bulldogs are very sensitive to heat;
              they may actually gain rather than lose heat due to their
              inefficient breathing, leading to a vicious cycle. Bulldogs must
              be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of
              standing heat.[16][28] They can even die from hyperthermia.[16]
              Bulldogs can be heavy breathers and tend to be loud snorers with
              interrupted sleep; another indicator of brachycephalic airway
              obstructive syndrome.[29] Many airlines ban the breed from flying
              in the cargo hold due to a high rate of deaths from air pressure
              interacting poorly with their breathing problems.

            <h4>The Golden Retriever</h4>

            <p>
              The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of
              dog; according to the Kennel Club breed standard, dogs stand from
              56 to 61 centimetres (22 to 24 in) and bitches from 51 to 56
              centimetres (20 to 22 in).[5][8] Healthy adult examples typically
              weigh between 25 and 34 kilograms (55 and 75 lb).[9] The Golden
              Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined stop, with dark
              eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black
              nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of
              moderate size set high and hanging with a slight fold.[9][10] The
              neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the
              shoulders well laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep
              through the chest with well-sprung ribs.[5][9][10] The back is
              usually level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is
              usually carried flat, roughly in line with the back.[5][9][10] The
              forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful
              with well bent stifles and muscular thighs, and the feet are
              cat-like.[5][9][10]

              The Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured
              and very affectionate breed of dog.[2][7] As is typical with
              retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being
              very easy to train and extremely keen to please their
              master.[5][7] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family
              dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to
              accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[3]
              Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid
              of guarding instincts.[3] The breed usually retains many of their
              gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell
              and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as
              gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their
              owners with toys or other objects.[5][7] Compared to other
              retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to
              mature.[7][11]. The Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by
              sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for
              competing in field trials.[2][7][11] It is used more for retrieval
              of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for
              wildfowl hunting.[7] Those used as gundogs are usually from
              working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or
              show lines are rarely suitable.[2][7][11] A Golden Retriever with
              a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold
              and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and
              insulation.[7][11] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden
              Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit
              low in the water when swimming.[7]
